            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This firſt Book propoſes, firſt in brief, the whole Subject,</hi> Mans diſobedience, and the loſs thereupon of Paradiſe wherein he was plac't: <hi>Then touches</hi> the prime cauſe of his fall, the Serpent, or rather <hi>Satan</hi> in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his ſide many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. <hi>Which action paſt over, the Poem haſts into the midſt of things, preſenting</hi> Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, <hi>deſcrib'd here,</hi> not in the Center <hi>(for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may be ſuppos'd as yet not made, certainly not yet accurſt)</hi> but in a place of utter darkneſs, fitliest call'd <hi>Chaos:</hi> Here <hi>Satan</hi> with his Angels lying on the burning Lake, thunder-ſtruck and aſtoniſht, after a certain ſpace recovers, as from confuſion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of thir mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Satan</hi> awakens all his Legions, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55147:6"/>lay till then in the ſame manner confounded; They riſe, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief Leaders nam'd, according to the Idols known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in <hi>Canaan</hi> and the Countries adjoyning. To theſe <hi>Satan</hi> directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them laſtly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created, according to an ancient Propheſie or report in Heaven; <hi>for that Angels were long before this viſible Creation, was the opinion of many ancient Fathers.</hi> To find out the truth of this Propheſie, and what to determin thereon he refers to a full Councel. What his Aſſociates thence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. <hi>Pandemonium</hi> the Place of <hi>Satan</hi> riſes, ſuddenly built out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there ſit in Councel.</p>

                  <p>God ſitting on his Throne ſees <hi>Satan</hi> flying towards this world, then newly created; ſhews him to the Son who ſat at his right hand; foretells the ſucceſs of <hi>Satan</hi> in perverting mankind; clears his own Juſtice and Wiſdom from all imputation, having created Man free and able enough to have withſtood his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet declares his purpoſe of grace towards him, in regard he fell not of his own malice, as did <hi>Satan,</hi> but by him ſeduc't. The Son of God renders praiſes to his Father for the manifeſtation of his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe towards Man; but God again declares, that Grace cannot be extended towards Man without the ſatisfaction of divine Juſtice; Man hath offended the majeſty of God by aſpiring to God-head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all his Progeny devoted to death must dye, unleſs ſome one can be found ſufficient to anſwer for his offence, and undergo his Puniſhment. The Son of God freely offers himſelf a Ranſome for Man: the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55147:35"/>Father accepts hint, ordains his incarnation, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his exaltation above all Names in Heaven and Earth; commands all the Angels to adore him; they obey, and hymning to thir Harps in full Quire, celebrate the Father and the Son. Mean while <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> alights upon the bare Convex of this Worlds outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Orb; where wandring he first finds a place ſince call'd The Lymbo of Vanity; what perſons and things fly up thither; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven, deſcrib'd aſcending by ſtaires, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the Firmament that flow about it: His paſſage thence to the Orb of the Sun; he finds there <hi>Uriel</hi> the Regient of that Orb, but first changes himſelf into the ſhape of a meaner Angel; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a zealous deſire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had plac't here, inquires of him the place of his habitation, and is directed; alights first on Mount <hi>Niphates.</hi>
